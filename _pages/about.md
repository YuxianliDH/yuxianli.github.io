Software systems written by humans tend to be unreliable and insecure. My research interests focus on developing practical techniques and tools that can help improve the reliability and security of software systems (mainly system software such as compilers and Linux kernels). I am quite interested in developing advanced automated approaches, based on program analysis techniques such as fuzzing and symbolic execution, to resolve labor-intensive engineering tasks, e.g., automatic bug finding and exploit generation.

Please kindly check my [CV](/files/cv.pdf) and feel free to drop me an email if you are offering any relevant positions (in either academia or industry). Let's work together to constantly push the boundaries a bit further!** </span>


## Recent News

  * [Dec 2023] **I have successfully defended my PhD thesis at DUT!** A milestone has been achieved, and I will keep fighting for another one :smiley:
  * [Nov 2023] Our paper titled "*Beyond a Joke: Dead Code Elimination Can Delete Live Code*" has been accepted to the NIER Track of the 46th IEEE ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE-NIER 2024)! See you in Lisbon!
  * [Sep 2023] A co-authored paper titled "*KRover: A Symbolic Execution Engine for Dynamic Kernel Analysis*" was accepted to the 2023 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2023), where we explored a new flavor of symbolic execution for kernel analysis!
  * [Jul 2023] We released a new paper "[*LLM4CBI: Taming LLMs to Generate Effective Test Programs for Compiler Bug Isolation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00593)", where we investigated the code generation capability of LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) for the compiler bug isolation task!
  * [Mar 2023] One paper titled "*Boosting Symbolic Execution for Heap-based Vulnerability Detection and Exploit Generation*" has been accepted to the Doctoral Symposium Track of IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2023)! See you in Melbourne!
