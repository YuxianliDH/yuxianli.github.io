I can't believe how fast time flies, but today I have to say goodbye to everyone at #MPI-SP (https://www.mpi-sp.org/) as it marks the official end of my 4-month internship in Marcel's group. 
First and foremost, I want to extend my deepest thanks to Marcel for giving me this incredible opportunity. Together, we worked on a new vulnerability-oriented path search strategy (where we suggest using type unsafe pointers to approximate the vulnerability behavior of a path and utilize a new unsafe pointer-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to navigate vulnerability-oriented path searches: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08772) and began exploring structural input generation for symbolic execution (ongoing work).
